 #Itadori, Nobara, Megumi, Gojo.

Nobara: Stare

#Itadori: I’m Itadori Yuuji, I’m from Sendai.

Megumi: Fushigiro Megumi 

#Nobara: He looks like a potato. He is definitely the type that ate his own boogers as a kid.
Nobara: And only a name here? I can’t stand high and mighty dudes. I bet he likes setting oils liked gulls on fire. I always get stuck unfortunate circumstances.

Itadori: She took one look and sighed 

Megumi: Are we going somewhere from here? 

#Gojo: We do have all three of you together. Not to mention two of you are from the countryside. So of course we are going on a tour of Tokyo. 

Itadory/Nobara: We love Tokyo
Megumi: Шо...??

#Nobara: TDL! I want to go to TDL!
Itadori: Idiot TDL is in Chiba! Lets go to the Chinatown Sensei
Nobara: Chinatown is in Yokohama!
Itadory: Yokohama is part of Tokyo! Don’t you now that? Look at the map.

Gojo: I will now announce our destination. The hell!? Ouit spouting nonsense! Roppongi

Itadori/Nobara: Ro-ppo-ngi!!

Gojo: There is a curse here

#Itadory/Nobara: You are a lier
Itadori: This isn’t even Roppongi!
Nobara: You were toying with us, country folk!
Gojo: There is a big cemetery nearby. The double whammy of that and an abandoned building brought out the curse.
Itadori: So they really do pop up more often around graves? 
Nobara: Who does he thinks is responsible for the rice he gets to eat, huh? 
Megumi: The issue isn’t the cemetery itself. Its the fact that people associate cemetery with fear. 
#Itadori: Oh, it was the same for schools too, wasn’t it?
Nobara: Hold up, he didn’t even know that yet?
Megumi: To be honest…
Nobara: He swallowed a special grade cursed object?! Gvvh? Unbelievable?! That’s so unsanitary and disgusting! 
Nobara: No way.(4x)(said with fear and trembling)
Itadori: What? 
Megumi: I agree with her
Gojo: I want to know what all of you are capable of. Just think of it as a field test. Nobara, Yuuji you two go exorcise the curse inside that building. 
#Nobara: Шо…?
Itadori: Га, I thought only curses could exorcise curses, right? I cannot use any jujutsu yet.
Gojo: you are basically halve a curse already. There is a cursed energy flowing throughout your body. Thou controlling that energy isn’t something you can learn over night. So use this.
*every one is confused* 
Gojo: It’s the cursed tool, Slaughter Demon. Its a weapon imbued with a cursed energy. It will work on curses too.
Nobara: Lame 

#Gojo: O one more thing, don’t let Sukuna out. 
Gojo: If you use it you will get rid of all the curses nearby in a flash. But you will also drag everyone around into it
Itadori: Got it, I won’t let Sukuna out
Nobara: Hurry it up!
Itadori: Yeh yeh, go on now
